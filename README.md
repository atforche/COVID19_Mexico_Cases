# COVID19_Mexico_Cases
A simple Git Repo that automatically updates the mexico_cases.csv file with the most recent COVID case information by municipality from the country of Mexico. Serves as my first experiment in automated Git workflows, as well as providing a convinient place to access Mexico's COVID information for a work project.
